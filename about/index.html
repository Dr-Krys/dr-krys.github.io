  <h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>
<p><img src="/profile.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I am a postdoc and a member of the <em>CO3</em> or <a href="https://crcn.ulb.ac.be/lab/co3/">Consciousness, Cognition &amp; Computation Group</a> at the <a href="https://crcn.ulb.ac.be">CRNC</a>.</p>
<p>Before coming to Brussels I was a member of the <a href="https://www.tobiasschlicht.com/team/">Situated Cognition Research Group</a> at the Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum where, among other things, I carried out a Volkswagen Foundation research grant on the psychology and epistemology of conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>My doctoral research was also conducted at the Ruhr-Universit√§t and was supervised by <a href="https://www.tobiasschlicht.com">Tobias Schlicht</a> and <a href="https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/">Daniel Dennett</a>. In my dissertation I investigated the way in which the computational models developed within the framework of predictive processing constrain the space of possible mechanisms underlying perceptual experience and whether the framework can yield a new perspective on the nature of consciousness. I was awarded my PhD in Philosophy with a grade of summa cum laude in May 2019. My work was also distinguished by the <a href="https://www.freunde-rub.de/nachrichten.html">GfD with the annual prize for the best interdisciplinary dissertation</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from computational models of cognitive functions, mental representations, and consciousness, I am also keenly interested in topics prominent in philosophy of computation, philosophy and ethics of AI, meta-cognition, and philosophy of science. When I&rsquo;m not doing philosophy, I spend most of my time tinkering with üêç scripts, üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è on gravel roads, and üßó in boulder gyms.</p>
